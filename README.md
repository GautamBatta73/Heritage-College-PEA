The Program Exit Assessment is a portfolio to display what we have learned in this program.
This portfolio will be helpful when we apply for jobs, as we will have something to show

### Personal Projects:
&emsp; SidGautamJS: A fully-functioning JavaScript library. It works very well and can be useful, but it has a steep learning curve. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/GautamBatta73/SidGautam/tree/0cfbf2483b5991a22ed2218be9f43323d1c5a13c/Versions/JavaScript)<br>
&emsp; SidGautamAI: A great ChatGPT alternative, using DeepSeek and Llama. It works very well and has a simple and pretty UI. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/GautamBatta73/SidGautam/tree/0cfbf2483b5991a22ed2218be9f43323d1c5a13c/Versions/AI_Chat_Assistant)<br>
