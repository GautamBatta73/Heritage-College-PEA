The Program Exit Assessment is a portfolio to display what we have learned in this program.
This portfolio will be helpful when we apply for jobs, as we will have something to show 
our knowledge.

### My Current Computer Science Courses:
  1. Development Project I
  2. IT Security
  3. Advanced Topics in Computer Science II
