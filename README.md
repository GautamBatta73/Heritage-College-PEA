The Program Exit Assessment is a portfolio to display what we have learned in this program.
This portfolio will be helpful when we apply for jobs, as we will have something to show 
our knowledge.

### My Current Computer Science Courses:
  1. Programming II
  2. Web Programming II
  3. Networks
  4. Business in The Workplace
