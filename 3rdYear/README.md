## The third year was a challenging continuation of the extremely frustrating parts of the Computer Science world.

<h3>First Semester</h3>

#### 1. Web Programming VI
      This course developed my ability to create web applications using C#/.Net and .NET Core frameworks for MVC. I also used Entity 
       Framework to connect to external databases. We also learn about creating and using web services and standard RESTful services.
#### 2. Development Project I
      In this course, we undertake the development of a new computer application for the college or an external client. Our primary 
       responsibility was to analyze the requirements for the application, which will be fully developed in Development Project II.
       Working in teams, we had to identify the functional requirements of the application, develop models and prototypes, identify 
       the technical alternatives, select an appropriate technical architecture, and start the development of the system using an 
       agile methodology.
#### 3. Systems Maintenance
      In this course, with a team, I helped to make enhancements to an existing application through the four types of maintenance: 
       corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive. I analyzed the requirements, made the necessary changes to the application,
       tested the application and updated the documentation. We were introduced to project management, development process standards
       and end-to-end software testing. I also learned about systems support, deployment, and operations. We were also taught how to 
       engage and interact with clients to gather requirements, present the outcome and validate their work through user acceptance 
       testing.
#### 4. Advanced Topics in Computer Science I
      This course focused on code efficiency, robustness, refactoring and maintainability. We perform code reviews and learned to 
       critique others’ code. We learned to use Python to solve a variety of computer-based problems and perform data analysis 
       operations. I also complete a research assignment on a topic in Computer Science, with mine being on "DNA Data Storage".
