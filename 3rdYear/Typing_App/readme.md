# Words Per Minute (WPM) Typing Application Code Snippets

**Application Requires .NET8, Daisy UI, Tailwind, NodeJS, PeerJS, and C#**

In my third year of Heritage, I had courses called 'Development Project I' and 'Development Project I', where my team and I had to build a website for a client.<br>

These are snippits of my contribution to the project: **The Dueling System**.<br>

These snippets show off how I implemented the type duel system using sockets, PeerJS, and a hosted Peer-Server.

I included the client-side JavaScript, the JavaScript to store the prefered layout, and the CSHTML View file for joining an existing duel.
