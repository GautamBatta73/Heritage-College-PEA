## Batman Online-Store
### Batcave Collectibles
<br>

**Requires C# ASP.NET 8**

This was the batman-themed website that I created for my first semester in my third year of the Computer Science program. <br>
It is a C#.NET Application that allows a user to "buy" products by loggin in/signing up, adding them to a cart, and entering some info. <br>
The stock will be decreased and it will say you bought a product (Unfortunatly, nothing will ever arrive at your door). <br>
There is even staff and admin accounts/features that allow you to manage the products, orders, categories, and more.
It has uses C#, REST Services and JavaScript for its functionality. It looks very pretty but does not work on mobile.<br><br>
