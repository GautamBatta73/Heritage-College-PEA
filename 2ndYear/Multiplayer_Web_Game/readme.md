## Multiplayer Web Game
### Pong
<br>

**Requires NodeJS**

This was the website that I created for my first semester in my second year of the Computer Science program. <br>
It is a multiplayer web game in which two players have a paddle, which they use to defend and knock a ball into their opponent's goal, for points. <br>
It has uses NodeJS, SocketIO, and Express for its functionality. It looks very pretty and even works on mobile.<br><br>
