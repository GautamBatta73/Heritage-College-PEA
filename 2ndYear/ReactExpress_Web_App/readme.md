## ReactExpress Web-App
### MovieList
<br>

**Requires NodeJS**

This was the website that I created for my first semester in my second year of the Computer Science program. <br>
It is a React Application that reads movies and actors from a JSON file. <br>
One may view the entire list of movies, or filter it by actor, genre, and name.
It has uses NodeJS, React, and Express for its functionality. It looks very pretty and even works on mobile.<br><br>
