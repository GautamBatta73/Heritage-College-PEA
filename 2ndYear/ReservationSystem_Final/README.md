# Happy Valley Kennels (HVK) Reservation System Final Site

**Requires .NET and C#**

In my second year of Heritage, I had a course called 'Web Programming V' in my second semester, where my team and I had to build a website for a pet reservation system.<br>
In the first semester, we created a pdf of the mockup/prototype: [here](https://github.com/HeritageCollegeClassroom/2022-program-exit-assessment-GautamBatta73/tree/cbbb21be650a110f1fea2c4d32c7e88c553d1df3/2ndYear/ReservationSystem_Prototype)
<br>And we also collected, and consolidated, user stories and user requirements: [here](https://github.com/HeritageCollegeClassroom/2022-program-exit-assessment-GautamBatta73/tree/cbbb21be650a110f1fea2c4d32c7e88c553d1df3/2ndYear/User_Stories%20%26%20User_Requirement%20Collecting)

This is the final site that was submitted by my team, and it may not be 100% done. But I still enjoyed doing the assignment and working with my team.
