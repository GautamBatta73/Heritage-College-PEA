    1. The game thinks of a word, and the player tries to guess it by suggesting letters.\n\n
    2. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, one for each letter.\n\n
    3. The player has 6 chances to guess the word by suggesting a letter that they think might be in the word.\n\n
    4. If the letter is present in the word, it is revealed in all its correct positions. If the letter is not present, a body part of a hanged figure is decomposed.\n\n
