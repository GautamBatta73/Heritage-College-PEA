# Hangman on Android
### Requires, Android API 31 minimum to run the source code; And Android 12 minimum to run the app (APK).

Everyone likes playing Hangman, right? Well, this is Hangman done in a Java JFrame, and it works and is really fun to play. <br>
This was an assignment of my Programming class, and the goal was to allow the user to play the game, save and exit, then load the game and start where they left off (using serialization/deserialization).<br>
The program displays the letters as blanks on the screen. The user has until the man is entirely hung, to try to guess letters, to complete the guessable word.<br>

**scrCode** is the Source Code for the app.

**HangmanGame_MobileAPK** is the apk file (it has an embedded list of words in the app).
