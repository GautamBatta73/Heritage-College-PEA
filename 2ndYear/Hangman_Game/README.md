# Hangman in a JFrame
### Requires, Java 17.0.0 minimum to run

Everyone likes playing Hangman, right? Well, this is Hangman done in a Java JFrame, and it works and is really fun to play. <br><br>

This was an assignment of my Programming class, and the goal was to allow the user to play the game, save and exit, then load the game and start where they left off (using serialization/deserialization).<br><br>

The program reads in the guessable words from a file and then displays the letters as blanks on the screen. The user has until the man is entirely hung to try to guess letters to complete the guessable word.<br>
