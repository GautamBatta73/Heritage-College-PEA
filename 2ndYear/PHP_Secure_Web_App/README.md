## PHP Secure Website
### PlayerLeague
<br>

**Requires PHP**

This was the website that I created for my second semester in my second year of the Computer Science program. <br>
It is a PHP Application that stores leader accounts and allows users to create accounts and login. <br>
Once logged in, the leader can create players with optional images.<br>
The goal of the final iteration of this site was to make it as secure as possible:
  - Great field validation (max/min character check, invalid character check, format/datatype check)
  - Account authentication and stored password encryption.
  - Keeps logs of an attempted intrusions.<br>

It has uses PHP for its functionality. It looks very pretty and even works on mobile.<br><br>
