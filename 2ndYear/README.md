## The second year was a great continuation of the more frustrating, yet still fun, parts of the Computer Science world.

<h3>First Semester</h3>

#### 1. Programming III
      Programming III was a good course that rounded out my knowledge of JFrames and Java, in general. It also taught me more complex
       programming concepts, like serialization. I also learned a lot about Android programming.
#### 2. Web Programming III
     Web Programming III was extremely fun. I was taught the basics of NodeJS and React.
#### 3. Database Management I
      This course taught me the basics of using Oracle SQL as a Database Manager. I also learned Database modelling and normalization.
#### 4. Systems Analysis
      This course taught me about the software development life cycle, with an emphasis on Agile and continuous delivery methodologies.
       I also learned about tools and techniques for identifying and analyzing user requirements. We also touched on good UI design.
