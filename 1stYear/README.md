## The first year was a fun introduction to the wonderfully frustrating world of Computer Science.

#### 1. Programming I
     Programming I was a wonderful course, though it made me despise JFrames.
#### 2. Web Programming I
     Web Programming I was a very fun course, though it made me dislike float.
      Flex is Superior.
#### 3. Hardware & OS
     Hardware & OS was very fun. I learned a lot about the Command Prompt and Security.
#### 4. Math for Computer Science
     Math has always been my favourite subject, but I absolutly hated this course.
