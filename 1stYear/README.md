## The first year was a fun introduction to the wonderfully frustrating world of Computer Science.

#### 1. Programming I
     Programming I was a wonderful course, though it made me despise JFrames.
#### 2. Web Programming I
     Web Programming I was aa very fun course, though I really hate float, a lot. (Flex is Superior)
#### 3. Hardware & OS
     Hardware & OS was very fun. I learned alot about the Command Prompt and Security.
#### 4. Math for Computer Science
     Math has always been my favourite subject, but I absolutly hated this course. 
      I learned a lot, but also lost my mind more than once.
