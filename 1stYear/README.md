## The first year was a fun introduction to the wonderfully frustrating world of Computer Science.
<br>
<h3>First Semester</h3>

#### 1. Programming I
     Programming I was a wonderful course, though it made me not fond of JFrames.
#### 2. Web Programming I
     Web Programming I was a very fun course, though it made me dislike float.
      Flex is Superior.
#### 3. Hardware & OS
     Hardware & OS was very fun. I learned a lot about the Command Prompt and Security.
#### 4. Math for Computer Science
     The course focused on base 2, 8, 10, and 16 numbers. We were taught to convert between them.

<h3>Second Semester</h3>
     
#### 1. Programming II
     Programming II was an amazing course, and it showed me the true brilliance of JFrames.
#### 2. Web Programming II
     Web Programming I was extremely fun, and absolutely love JavaScript (Not as much as Java, though).
     The course inspired me to create my own JavaScript Library: https://www.github.com/GautamBatta73/SidGautam.
#### 3. Networks
     As a whole, the only thing I liked, was that we were taught how VPNs work and how Network infrastructures are built.
#### 4. Business in The Workplace
     As a whole, Business was quite boring. However, I enjoyed learning about interpersonal skills.
